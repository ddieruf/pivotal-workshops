      <description>User Provided Services with Steeltoe Goal Environment variables are a very powerful feature of cloud native applications but sometimes we need all the apps in a given space (or environment) to share settings. User provided services are a great way to accomplish this. In this lab we will create a service that is available to all apps in a given space via environment variables.
Note, this lab assumes you already have the Steeltoe template app opened in Visual Studio and you have already logged in to a foundation with the cf cli.</description>
